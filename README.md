#  Used Car Price Prediction
 Project Overview

This project predicts the price of used cars based on features such as engine size, horsepower, weight, and brand.
It demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline: data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

I built this notebook as part of my data science portfolio to showcase skills in EDA, regression modeling, and model deployment readiness.


#  Tools & Libraries

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, preprocessing, metrics)

Joblib (model persistence)

Jupyter/Kaggle Notebook


#  Methodology

Data Loading & Cleaning

- Imported dataset from Kaggle (CarPrice_Assignment.csv)

- Extracted car brand from name & fixed typos

- Handled categorical variables with one-hot encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized correlations between features and car prices

- Checked for missing values & outliers

Modeling

- Linear Regression (baseline)

- Random Forest Regressor (improved accuracy)

Evaluation

- Metrics: RÂ² score, RMSE

- Random Forest significantly outperformed Linear Regression


Results & Insights

- Horsepower, engine size, and curb weight were the most influential features

- Actual vs. Predicted plot showed good model performance


#  Results

Linear Regression:

RÂ² = -1.0419497587222164e+24

RMSE = 9069493012738966.0

Random Forest:

RÂ² = 0.9584

RMSE = 1811.84
